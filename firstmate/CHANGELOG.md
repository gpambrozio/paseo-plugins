# Changelog

Notable changes to `firstmate`. The other plugins in this repository version separately.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the version numbers
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Every version is published to npm
as `@gpambrozio/paseo-firstmate` and tagged here, so a version is something to install and a line to
read before you move.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-22

### Added

- **A first mate that runs a crew of agents for you.** Launch it from the new FirstMate panel in the
  sidebar and tell it what you need; it hands each task to a worker agent in its own git worktree,
  supervises it to the end, and brings you pull requests, findings, and only the decisions that are
  yours. Workers are ordinary Paseo agents you can open and read like any other.
- **A board of the crew** beside the conversation: queued, working, blocked, parked, done, failed and
  idle, with each worker's last word and its pull request. Steer a worker, interrupt it, end it, or
  have the first mate relaunch it, from its card.
- **`/fm`, `/bearings` and `/ahoy`** in any composer: talk to the first mate from anywhere, get a
  four-part catch-up on where everything stands, or a recap of what happened with every open decision.
- **A FirstMate tab** beside a worker's workspace and session, showing its card.
- **Answer the first mate's questions in the panel.** When it asks you to choose, or needs your
  permission or a plan approved, the question appears in the chat and you answer it there, without
  opening the first mate itself.
- **Opening the panel marks the first mate as seen**, so its workspace in the sidebar reads as done
  rather than waiting for you, just as if you had opened the first mate itself.
- **Standing orders you write yourself**, in the first mate's home, which it reads every session and
  follows ahead of its own charter.
